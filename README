Jenkins installation environment
================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository provides a quick installation method for Jenkins on a
Linux system (only tested with Ubuntu though). The provided toolset is
certainly not applicable in all situations but it may help the one or
the other to get a quick Jenkins installation up and running.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using this repostiory you need to have the following software
installed:

 - Make
 - Java (Sun JDK)


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to allow for local configuration settings you need to copy
the distributed configuration file first:

cp ./etc/jenkins.local.dist ./etc/jenkins.local

Now you can edit ./etc/jenkins.local and override any settings from
./etc/jenkins in there. You will find some suggestions in
./etc/jenkins.local. It is most likely that you would want to fix the
user name used to run the jenkins server. The default is "jenkins"
which might not exist on your system. Especially for test
installations you should simply set JENKINS_USER to your own user
name.

Once the configuration has been set you can simply run

 make install

followed by

 make start

You should be able to connect to http://localhost:8080 now.


Usage
~~~~~

1. Starting / Stopping the server

 make start

should fire the server up

 make stop

should kill the server.

2. Installing what Jenkins upstream provides as "latest" packages:

 make install-latest

These are not necessary the "latest" packages released and there may
be updates available. But you will be notified of that whithin the
Jenkins management console.


Uninstall
~~~~~~~~~

Simply run

 make stop

followed by

 make clean

This should fully remove the Jenkins server.
